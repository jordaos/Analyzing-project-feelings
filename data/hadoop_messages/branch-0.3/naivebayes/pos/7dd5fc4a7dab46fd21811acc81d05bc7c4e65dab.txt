Fix for HADOOP-66.  DFS blocks are no longer written to local temp files.  If a connection to a datanode fails then an exception is now thrown, rather than trying to re-connect to another datanode.  Timeouts were also removed from datanode connections, since these caused a lot of failed connections.
