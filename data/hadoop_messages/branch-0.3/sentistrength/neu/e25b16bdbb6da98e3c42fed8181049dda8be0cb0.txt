Don't always query jobtracker for all needed map outputs, instead just
for a random sample.  When the total number of splits was large, the
jobtracker was spending most of its time servicing these requests.
Also reduce the frequency of these requests.  Long-term we may need a
different algorithm here to ensure that reduces are more promptly and
efficiently notified of map completions.
