Fix for HADOOP-70.  Unit tests should have their own hadoop-site.xml and mapred-default.xml, so that local modifications to these files in conf/ don't alter unit testing.  Also rename TestDFS so that it is not normally run, and add a new test target which runs tests using the config files in conf/.
