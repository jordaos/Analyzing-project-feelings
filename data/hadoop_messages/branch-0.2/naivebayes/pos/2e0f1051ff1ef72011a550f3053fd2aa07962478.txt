Apply local Configuration to parameters received via RPC if they
implement Configurable. Fix by Marko Bauhardt.

Note: in the future there may be protocols that assume
different local and remote Configuration. However, with the
current RPC implementation we don't support it anyway, and for
now it seems better that parameters implementing Configurable
should be provided with non-null Configuration.
